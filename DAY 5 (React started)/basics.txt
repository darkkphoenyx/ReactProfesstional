react is SPA--> single page application--> which means it does not reload the page instead reloads/rendered only the components
node ---> run time environment for JavaScript
npm--> node package manager
yam--> is also a package manager
 
spa--> single page application--> made using react and others

we will be using Vite for now  to use react
command: npm create vite@latest <projet_name>
for raw React: npx create-react-app <projet_Name>

vite is a hmr-->hot module replacement---> does not reload the whole page

<> </> --> is a fragment
or <fragment> </fragment> --> is also a fragment  --> kinda similar to open div and close div

states in react
--> information is temporarily stored

props--> properties, we can pass    -parameter
                                    -function
                                    we can use props to pass variable back and forth parent and child
